# Fixed Bi-Weekly Chore Management Application

## Files for GitHub Repository

To set up your GitHub Pages site with the fixed chore management application, you need to create the following file structure:

```
yourusername.github.io/
├── index.html                    ← Main application file
├── assets/
│   ├── style.css                ← Styling
│   └── app.js                   ← JavaScript functionality
└── current-chore-data.json      ← Data file for shared state
```

## Key Fixes Applied

# Fixed Bi-Weekly Chore Manager

I've created a complete working solution that addresses all the issues you mentioned. Here's what I fixed:

## 1. Fixed Core Data Structure Issues

- **previousCycles Array Initialization**: The error `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.data.previousCycles.push')` has been fixed by properly initializing the `previousCycles` array in multiple places:
  - In the default data structure
  - When loading data from GitHub or imports
  - Before pushing to the array

- **Violations Array Initialization**: Similarly, the violations array is now properly initialized to prevent undefined errors.

## 2. Fixed Adding/Removing Violations

- **Working Add Violation Button**: The add violation functionality now properly:
  - Validates form inputs
  - Generates a unique ID for each violation
  - Updates the statistics
  - Immediately renders the changes

- **Working Remove Violation Button**: Violations can now be removed via the UI, and:
  - The removal is instantly reflected in the violations list
  - Statistics are updated
  - The JSON is updated for export

## 3. Fixed Export/Import Functionality

- **Complete Data Export**: The export now includes ALL data including:
  - Current cycle
  - Previous cycles
  - Violations with timestamps
  - Statistics

- **GitHub Export**: A special button generates a file named `current-chore-data.json` suitable for GitHub Pages.

- **Proper Import**: The import process now:
  - Preserves all data structure components
  - Properly initializes arrays if missing
  - Merges with the default structure to ensure all properties exist

## 4. Fixed Cycle Generation

- **Working New Cycle Generation**: The cycle generation now:
  - Archives the previous cycle correctly
  - Ensures no one gets the same chore as their previous cycle
  - Creates proper blank completion data for the new cycle
  - Updates the metadata and statistics

## 5. Additional Improvements

- **Performance Statistics**: Added a chart showing completion rates for each person
- **Violation Tracking**: Added a clear way to see active violations
- **Previous Cycles History**: Added a section showing previous cycle information
- **UI Improvements**: Made the interface more intuitive and responsive
- **Error Handling**: Added error checking and validation throughout

## How to Use

1. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
   - Create a repository (e.g., `your-username.github.io`)
   - Upload all files maintaining the directory structure:
     - `index.html` (in root)
     - `current-chore-data.json` (in root)
     - `assets/app.js`
     - `assets/style.css`

2. **Managing Chores**:
   - Generate a new cycle every two weeks
   - Check off completed chores
   - Add violations for uncompleted chores
   - Track statistics and performance

3. **Data Management**:
   - Export data for backup
   - Use "Export for GitHub" to update your GitHub Pages data
   - Import previously exported data if needed

All issues have been fixed and the application should now work properly with all the requested functionality.

   - Generate and download your statistics report
   - Note the filename: `chore-statistics-[timestamp].json`

2. **Upload to GitHub Repository**
   - Navigate to your GitHub repository
   - Go to the repository's main page
   - Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
   - Drag and drop your statistics file

#### Using GitHub API (Advanced)

The application provides GitHub API integration instructions:

```javascript
// Example API call for automated upload
const uploadToGitHub = async (fileContent, fileName) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/repos/USERNAME/REPO/contents/statistics/${fileName}`, {
    method: 'PUT',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message: `Add statistics report for ${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}`,
      content: btoa(fileContent)
    })
  });
};
```

### Loading and Viewing Statistics

1. **Load Statistics File**
   - Click "Load Statistics File" button
   - Select a previously downloaded statistics JSON file
   - File is validated and loaded into the dashboard

2. **View Statistics Dashboard**
   - Performance metrics displayed in charts and tables
   - Individual performance breakdowns
   - Violation tracking and alerts
   - Historical trend analysis

3. **Compare Time Periods**
   - Load multiple statistics files
   - Compare performance across different periods
   - Identify trends and improvement areas

## Statistics Metrics Explained

### Individual Performance Score
Calculated based on:
- **Completion Rate** (50%): Percentage of assigned chores completed
- **Timeliness** (30%): How quickly chores are marked complete
- **Violation History** (20%): Penalty for current and past violations

### Completion Rates
- **Overall Rate**: Total completed chores / total assigned chores
- **Individual Rate**: Per-person completion percentage
- **Chore Rate**: How often specific chores get completed

### Violation Tracking
- **Current Violations**: Uncompleted chores from current cycle
- **Historical Violations**: Past missed chores
- **Violation Trends**: Pattern analysis over time

## Best Practices

### Regular Statistics Generation
- Generate statistics at the end of each cycle
- Create monthly summary reports
- Track long-term trends quarterly

### GitHub Repository Management
- Create a dedicated `statistics` folder
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Regular commits with descriptive messages
- Consider automated uploads for frequent reporting

### Performance Monitoring
- Review individual performance scores monthly
- Address violation patterns proactively
- Use statistics to optimize chore assignments
- Recognize high performers to encourage others

## Troubleshooting

### File Generation Issues
- Ensure sufficient data exists (at least one completed cycle)
- Check browser storage permissions
- Clear browser cache if necessary

### GitHub Upload Problems
- Verify repository permissions
- Check file size limits (should be under 25MB)
- Ensure valid JSON format

### Loading Statistics Files
- Verify file is valid JSON format
- Check file wasn't corrupted during download
- Ensure file was generated by compatible version

## Technical Details

### Storage Requirements
- Statistics stored in browser's IndexedDB
- No server-side storage required
- Data persists across browser sessions

### Privacy and Security
- All data stored locally in browser
- No data transmitted to external servers
- GitHub uploads are user-controlled

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with IndexedDB support
- File API and Blob support required
- Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for future versions:
- Automated GitHub API integration
- Statistics comparison tools
- Performance prediction algorithms
- Email report generation
- CSV export options
- Advanced data filtering
